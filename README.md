# yatai-deployment

yatai-deployment is a yatai component dedicated to deploying Bento to Kubernetes

## Description

yatai-deployment runs in k8s, it is the operator of `BentoDeployment` CRD, it is responsible for reconcile `BentoDeployment` CR and then create workloads and services for Bento. It relies on `Bento` CR to get the image and runners information, so it should install after the [yatai-image-builder](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai-image-builder) component installation.

## Installation

You should read the [installation guide](https://docs.bentoml.org/projects/yatai/en/latest/installation/yatai_deployment.html) to install yatai-deployment in a production environment.

## Contributing

Contributing code or documentation to the project by submitting a Github pull request. Check out the [Development Guide](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai-deployment/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make start-dev
```

**NOTE:** The more information you should check the [Development Guide](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai-deployment/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
